# Title: Pandas for Data Analysis

Name: Raghav Garg 
* Roll No:102303066

# 1. Methodology

The project follows a step-by-step data analysis workflow using the Pandas library, starting from data loading to performing exploratory and statistical analysis on structured datasets.

# 2. Description

This Coursera Guided Project focuses on understanding and applying Pandas for data analysis. It covers essential operations such as creating Series and DataFrames, reading CSV files, sorting data, handling missing values, and performing aggregate operations.

# 3. Input / Output

Input:
* CSV datasets
* Python lists and dictionaries

Output:
* Cleaned and structured Pandas Series and DataFrames
* Statistical summaries and analytical results

# 4. Tools & Technologies

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Jupyter Notebook

# 5. Sample Tasks Performed

Loading datasets into Pandas DataFrames and Series
* Sorting data in ascending and descending order
* Checking membership of values in a dataset
* Computing averages manually and using built-in methods
* Understanding data types and structure of Pandas objects

# 6. Key Concepts Covered

Creating and manipulating Pandas Series and DataFrames
* Reading data from CSV files using read_csv()
* Exploring datasets using:
.head(), .info(), .describe()

* Data selection and indexing
* Sorting values and indexes
* Handling missing values

* Performing statistical operations:
sum(), mean(), count()
* Working with .values, .index, and .dtype

* The project is implemented using Jupyter Notebook, providing an interactive environment for running Pandas operations and visualizing outputs.
